Louise is creating a card game for two players.
The game uses a deck of cards. There are 30 cards in a deck.
Each card has one colour (red, black or yellow). Each card has
a number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) for each colour. Each card
is unique.
The 30 cards are shuffled and stored in the deck.
The rules are:
• Player 1 takes the top card from the deck.
• Player 2 takes the next card from the deck.
• If both players have a card of the same colour, the player with the highest number wins.
• If both players have cards with different colours, the winning colour is shown in the table.

Card Card Winner
Red Black Red
Yellow Red Yellow
Black Yellow Black

• The winner of each round keeps both cards.
• The players keep playing until there are no cards left in the deck.
